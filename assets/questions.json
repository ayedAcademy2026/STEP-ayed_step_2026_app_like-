When vaccinated, the body produces antibodies and memory cells that respond quickly to future exposure. This not only protects individuals but can also reduce the spread of disease within a community, especially when a high percentage of people are immunized. However, no vaccine is perfect; effectiveness can vary depending on the pathogen and the person’s immune response. For this reason, public health strategies often combine vaccination with monitoring and additional preventive measures."

Many students try to multitask—studying while checking messages—but research shows that switching tasks creates a cost. Even brief interruptions can reduce understanding, because the brain must re‑orient each time. A simple strategy is to study in short blocks, keep your phone out of reach, and take planned breaks. That way, your focus is protected and your review becomes more efficient."
